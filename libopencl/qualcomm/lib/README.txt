libopencl is not allowed to be distributed.

You have to find your own copy to link against.
Go to the play store and download "OpenCL-Z" to see if you have openCL on your device.
If you do, then you can copy the opencl lib from your device.

Place the copy into this directory, named "libOpenCL.so"

Make sure to copy over the right lib, 32 or 64bit, depending on which arch you are compiling for
